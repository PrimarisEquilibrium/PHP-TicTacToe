# PHP TicTacToe

## A local web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with PHP, Typescript, and Twig.

This project is a primitive tic-tac-toe project with the focus on furthering my knowledge on full stack web technologies. The primary objective is to understand how to use PHP for server-side knowledge, AJAX for asynchronous data communication between the front-end and back-end, Typescript for type-safe front-end scripting, and Twig for seperating PHP code from HTML via. efficient templating.
